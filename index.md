* Lab 4

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part, part 3 was another lab I liked because this had to do with writing information in files which I found really interesting. Considering that I am very familiar with files since I own a lot of tech, working with files was really amusing and inspiring.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part, part  2 was I think my overall favorite of them all, it was the first official game I got to code and I was super intrigued making the game, putting my own little messages for the results of the number guessing game.
